## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the course **Algorithms for Massive Data** at the **University of Milan**. It addresses **Project 3**, which involves designing and implementing a **ranking system using the PageRank algorithm** applied to book review data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

 [Amazon Books Reviews â€“ Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews)

## Notebooks

The repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

- `AMD_AMIRIAN_SUBSETRUN_RUNS_ON_COLAB.ipynb`:  
  A subset version intended for quick testing and demonstration.  
   Recommended for use on **Google Colab**.  
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Dianaamrn/LinkAnalysis-AMD/blob/main/AMD_AMIRIAN_SUBSETRUN_RUNS_ON_COLAB.ipynb)

- `AMD_AMIRIAN_FULLRUN_LOCAL_ONLY.ipynb`:  
  The full-scale version using the complete dataset.  
   Designed to be run **locally** due to high memory and processing requirements.

## Additional Work

A separate **scalability analysis** was conducted to evaluate how PageRank performance scales with increasing dataset size.
