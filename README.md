# LinkAnalysis-AMD
Project Overview:


This project was developed by as part of the course Algorithms for Massive Data at the University of Milan. It addresses Project 3, which involves designing and implementing a ranking system using the PageRank algorithm applied to book review data.

The repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

AMD_AMIRIAN_SUBSETRUN_RUNS_ON_COLAB.ipynb:
A subset version intended for quick testing and demonstration.
✅ Recommended for use on Google Colab.

AMD_AMIRIAN_FULLRUN_LOCAL_ONLY.ipynb:
The full-scale version of the system using the complete dataset.
⚠️ Recommended to run on local PC due to higher memory and processing demands.

Additional Work
A separate scalability test was performed to evaluate performance across different dataset sizes.
